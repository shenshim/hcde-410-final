The "Generations: A Study of the Life and Health of LGBTQ People in a Changing Society, United States 2016-2019" dataset, sourced from the ICPSR, is a scientifically practical and useful resource. It examines the health and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals across three generations in America, exploring identity, stress, health outcomes, and health care utilization. The research aims to understand how the treatment and experiences of LGBTQ+ people have evolved over different generations, with a focus on accessible care, affirming treatments, and the mental health of youth.
