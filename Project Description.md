**Motivation and problem statement**

I will be using the "Generations: A Study of the Life and Health of LGBTQ People in a Changing Society, United States 2016-2019" dataset. It's scientifically practical and useful data sourced from the ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research), which includes members such as Johns Hopkins and Mayo Clinic. The ICPSR is the world's largest collection of digital social science data, providing leadership training in data access, curation, and methods of analysis for the social science research community.

I specifically chose this dataset to examine health and well-being across three generations of LGBTQ+ people in America. The study explores identity, stress, health outcomes, and health care/service utilization among the three generations of adults who came of age during different historical contexts. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I am personally interested in this data and wish to broaden my knowledge of how the treatment (social, medical, personal) of LGBTQ+ people in America has changed over different generations.

The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/DSDR/studies/37166/summary).

The data is for public use, with the exception of one file that contains variables pertaining to (trigger warning) sexual harassment. I do not plan on including it, as the dataset already has a robust amount of variables of interest to this project. The main research question for this project is: How have the lives of LGBTQ+ people in America changed over three generations? This branches out to examining changes in terms of accessible care, affirming treatments, and mental health of youth.

Ethical concerns: will need a trigger warning prior to presenting, and I will try my best to avoid high intensity, sensitive topics. 

No personal unknowns and dependencies on my end. 

**Feedback**: Very interesting data and research question! Looks like there's a lot of qualitative data, so be diligent with analyzing it and finding the best methods to do so.

**Overview and Research Questions**

(Motivation and goal above) Building ontop of the motivation and problem statement, I would like to focus on various aspects of the lives and experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals in America across different generations. I will cover three main topics: societal attitudes, healthcare outcomes (gender affirming treatments, HIV care), and mental health of queer youth across three generations. 

Research questions: 

1: _How have attitudes towards LGBTQ+ individuals change across three generations in America?
- Sub 1: Are there significant differences in identity exploration and self-acceptance among LGBTQ+ individuals across generations?

Hypothesis for Q1) There will be an increase in positive attitudes towards LGBTQ+ individuals across three generations in America. The hypothesis is based on the assumption that societal attitudes towards LGBTQ+ individuals have generally become more accepting over time. This can be attributed to increased visibility, advocacy efforts, and legal advancements that have aimed to promote equality and inclusivity. LGBTQ+ individuals from younger generations will exhibit higher levels of identity exploration and self-acceptance compared to older generations. This stems from the idea that younger generations have grown up in a more accepting and inclusive environment, with greater exposure to diverse gender and sexual identities. As a result, they may feel more empowered to explore their identities and be more accepting of themselves compared to older generations who may have faced more stigma and discrimination.

2: _How has access to healthcare services improved or changed for LGBTQ+ individuals over time?
- Sub 1: How has the availability and utilization of affirming treatments for LGBTQ+ individuals evolved across generations?
- Sub 2: What are the experiences of LGBTQ+ youth in terms of mental health and well-being compared to previous generations?

Hypothesis for Q2) Access to healthcare services for LGBTQ+ individuals has improved over time, leading to increased utilization and better health outcomes. This hypothesis is based on the expectation that as societal attitudes have become more accepting, healthcare systems have made efforts to address the specific needs of LGBTQ+ individuals. This includes providing LGBTQ+ culturally competent care, removing barriers to access, and increasing awareness among healthcare providers, which may have led to improved healthcare access and ultimately better health outcomes. Affirming treatments for LGBTQ+ individuals have become more available and have been improved across generations. The hypothesis assumes that advancements in medical and psychological understanding of LGBTQ+ identities have led to the development and increased availability of affirming treatments. These treatments may include hormone therapy, gender-affirming surgeries, and mental health services tailored to the unique needs of LGBTQ+ individuals. LGBTQ+ youth will report better mental health and well-being compared to previous generations, partly due to improved access to healthcare services and increased societal acceptance.
This hypothesis suggests that the combination of improved access to healthcare services and increased societal acceptance may have positively impacted the mental health and overall well-being of LGBTQ+ youth. Reduced stigma and discrimination, along with access to affirming resources, may contribute to better mental health outcomes for this generation.

3: _What were/are the affirming resources that LGBTQ+ individuals utilized at the time of their youth across the three generations?

Hypothesis for Q3)LGBTQ+ individuals in different generations utilized different affirming resources during their youth. This is largely based on the assumption that affirming resources and support networks available to LGBTQ+ individuals have evolved and changed over time. Different generations may have had access to different organizations, community centers, online platforms, or support groups that provided them with affirming resources during their youth. There will be a shift in the types and availability of affirming resources across the three generations, reflecting changes in societal attitudes and advancements in support networks for LGBTQ+ individuals. This hypothesis proposes that as societal attitudes have progressed and support networks have developed, the types and availability of affirming resources for LGBTQ+ individuals have also changed. For example, older generations may have relied more on LGBTQ+ community centers or local support groups, while younger generations may have access to online communities and virtual resources.

**Background and Related Work**

_Research Question 1:

Background: Previous research has shown that societal attitudes towards LGBTQ+ individuals have evolved over time. In the United States, there has been a gradual shift towards greater acceptance and inclusion of LGBTQ+ identities, accompanied by advancements in legal protections and increased visibility of LGBTQ+ individuals in various aspects of society.

Related Work: Numerous studies have examined changes in attitudes towards LGBTQ+ individuals across different generations. For example, a study conducted by Herek and colleagues found that younger generations tend to exhibit more positive attitudes and greater support for LGBTQ+ rights compared to older generations. Other research has explored the impact of generational differences on attitudes towards same-sex relationships, transgender rights, and overall LGBTQ+ acceptance.

_Research Question 2:

Background: The healthcare experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals have been a subject of investigation, highlighting disparities in access to healthcare services, discrimination, and health outcomes. Prior research has identified barriers such as lack of provider knowledge, discrimination, and limited access to culturally competent care.

Related Work: Several studies have examined changes in healthcare access and utilization among LGBTQ+ individuals over time. For instance, a study by Grant and colleagues found that LGBTQ+ individuals reported improvements in healthcare access and more affirming experiences with healthcare providers over the years. Other research has investigated the impact of inclusive healthcare policies and the availability of affirming treatments on the well-being and health outcomes of LGBTQ+ individuals.

_Research Question 3:

Background: Affirming resources and support networks have played a crucial role in the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals. These resources can include LGBTQ+ community centers, support groups, helplines, online platforms, and mental health services tailored to their specific needs.

Related Work: Previous studies have explored the availability and utilization of affirming resources among LGBTQ+ individuals across different generations. For example, research has examined changes in the types of support networks utilized by LGBTQ+ individuals, considering factors such as generational differences, geographic location, and community dynamics. Studies have also investigated the impact of affirming resources on mental health, social connectedness, and resilience among LGBTQ+ individuals.

**Methodology**

I will be exporting the dataset in R, creating derived variables or recode existing variables as needed to align with the research questions. (+ Filtering the dataset to include relevant variables and observations for each research question.)

For RQ 1, I will conduct a descriptive analysis to examine the changes in attitudes towards LGBTQ+ individuals across three generations. This can include calculating mean scores, frequencies, or proportions and comparing them between generations.

For RQ 2, I will utilize statistical analysis techniques such as logistic regression or chi-square tests to assess the changes in access to healthcare services and utilization across generations. Analyze the availability and utilization of affirming treatments using descriptive statistics and compare them between generations.

For RQ 3, I will perform qualitative analysis by examining qualitative data or open-ended responses to identify affirming resources utilized by LGBTQ+ individuals during their youth. Categorize and compare the resources across generations.

Presentation:

For RQ 1, I will create bar charts or line graphs to illustrate the changes in attitudes towards LGBTQ+ individuals across generations.
For RQ 2, I will present the results of statistical tests in tables or graphs, showing the differences in healthcare access and utilization between generations.
For RQ 3, I will present a thematic analysis or categorization of the affirming resources utilized during each generation, possibly using tables or qualitative summaries.
